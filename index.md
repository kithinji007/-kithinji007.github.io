### Data Visualization and Analysis

[Microsoft Movie Studio Analysis](https://github.com/kithinji007/Microsoft-Movie-Studio-Analysis) <br>
Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they don’t know anything about creating movies. I researched what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office and translated the findings into actionable insights. <br>

[LinkedIn Engagements analysis](https://github.com/kithinji007/BI/blob/main/TJ%20Linkedin.pbix) <br>
LinkedIn engagement analytics measures the performance of your campaigns, posts and videos. Specifically, you can find out whether your content is resonating with the target audience and how they’re responding to it. This project was dear to me as I wanted to understand LinkedIn's dynamics.
